DYNAMICALLY RENDERED SCRAPING
------------------------------

> This project demostrates how to scrape websites with dynamically loaded content
> It is very useful for handling "show more" buttons and automating this process
> Currently I have the script connecting to webpage and clicking the show more button dynamically

*Note that the current case solves a problem that appears to be confusing for many. I spent a considerable amount of time to get to this point and thus anyone looking to scrape pages such as the one in the example will have a much easier time following this script. The script deals with javascript:void(0) which is a nighmare to scrape in normal circumstances!*
